The initial task was to decide upon the niche for my website portfolio. This course gave me an opportunity to explore the art of photography and I found it very intriguing. I developed a liking for the skill throughout the term. The next step was to create brand identity for myself. I did that by creating a unique logo using positive and negative space in Adobe illustrator. I faced several challenges during the creation of the website. The prime difficulty that I faced was to choose an appropriate layout to display my work using grid and flexbox. Later, after further research and some experimentation I finalize my Portfolio pictures presentation. It was a great opportunity to test my web designing skills and put the knowledge that I have gained through the course into practice.
